## Preprints
Yoav Goldberg discusses the issues around "flag planting" in first section of [this article](https://medium.com/@yoav.goldberg/an-adversarial-review-of-adversarial-generation-of-natural-language-409ac3378bd7). 
^ also been dicussions about the tone of this review.

Issues with people just posting abstracts. Or whole papers but no methods. Overarching theme *does lack of quality control diminish the importance of pre-prints?* Or highlight the need for overlay journals?

## Open Evaluation (+preprints)
Dicussion on twitter - centres around should we allow public access to "unfiltered" science. Issues with media/journalists hopping on anything. - Is this more of a problem with OA/OE givent that some journals will publish anything anyway?

take home that people need to be called out publicly. Community needs to be actively inclusive.
